# What is this?

I took my first computer science course in high school when I was 14. We learned basically how to make loops in Java and for our final project we had to make some sort of game (think blackjack, something like that).

I LOVED coding so much I spent over 100 hours building a functional RPG game in the same style as Zork / those old Infocom games I used to play at the time. And it WORKED. I recently stumbled upon this project again and am porting it to JS to run client-side in a browser. The code is horrendous and repetitive and I didn't make much of an effort to change it here as I just wanted to get things running. Fortunately, I commented __literally every single line__ of the project, so at least it was very easy to follow.

This is a WIP while I am bored while studying. Code and story are all mine, but the poor style, lack of design patterns, and questionable use of classes makes me not want to take ownership for it. Every string is hardcoded as a constant! But that is how I understood things as a kid, so it's quite wholesome to look at and see how far I've come.

Cheers,
